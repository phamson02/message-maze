## Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the help of GPT-4, a powerful AI model by OpenAI. Throughout more than 140 exchanges, GPT-4 provided invaluable assistance in transferring the original Python project to JavaScript and creating a user-friendly web application.

The human author of this project had not previously learned JavaScript in depth. However, with the assistance of GPT-4, the author was able to create a functional and visually appealing web application.
